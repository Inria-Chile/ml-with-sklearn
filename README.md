## Using the notebooks on the cloud

Open the notebooks in [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Inria-Chile/ml-with-sklearn/HEAD) (recommended) or in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Inria-Chile/ml-with-sklearn).

## Installing locally

- Requirements:
  - Python >=3.8 and <12 and
  - [Poetry dependency manager](https://python-poetry.org).
- Install required libraries (they will go in a `.venv` virtual environment in the current folder).

  ```zsh
  poetry install
  ```

- Activate virtual environment:

  ```zsh
  poetry shell
  ```

- Run notebooks:

  ```zsh
  jupyter notebook
  ```

- Check that all notebooks are working (will take a while):

  ```zsh
  pytest -n=auto --nbmake --nbmake-timeout=600 **/*ipynb 
  ```
